State encoding is a necessity when complex time series are being analyzed. For
example, :math:`k`-history must be encoded as an integer in order to "observe"
it using a :py:class:`~.dist.Dist`. What if you are interested in correlating
the aggragate state of one group of nodes with that of another? You'd need to
encode the groups' states as integers. This module
(:py:mod:`pyinform.utils.encoding`)provides such functionality.

.. attention::

    As a practical matter, these utility functions should only be used as a
    stop-gap while a solution for your problem is implemented in the core
    `Inform <https://github.com/elife-asu/inform>`_ library. "Why?" you ask?
    Well, these functions are about as efficient as they can be for one-off
    state encodings, but most of the time you are interested in encoding
    sequences of states. This can be done much more efficiently if you encode
    the entire sequence at once. You need domain-specific information to make
    that happen.
    
    This being said, these functions aren't bad just be aware that they may turn
    into a bottleneck in whatever you are implementing.
